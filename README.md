# Deploy Strapi to Render

This is a sample [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) app, configured for deployment to [Render](https://render.com). It uses a [managed PostgreSQL database](https://render.com/docs/databases) to store structured content and a [persistent disk](https://render.com/docs/disks) to store uploaded Media Library files.

See the guide at https://render.com/docs/deploy-strapi for more information.
